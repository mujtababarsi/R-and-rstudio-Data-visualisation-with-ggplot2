**R & RStudio: Data Visualisation with ggplot2**

A comprehensive collection of R scripts and projects focused on the Grammar of Graphics. This repository explores how to transform raw data into insightful, publication-quality visualizations using RStudio and the ggplot2 library.

🚀 **Overview**

This project demonstrates the power of ggplot2 to create layered graphics. It covers everything from basic scatter plots to advanced faceting and theme customisation. The goal is to provide a clear workflow for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data storytelling.

📊 **Key Visualisations Included**

    Distribution: Histograms, Density Plots, and Boxplots.

    Correlation: Scatter plots with regression lines (geom_smooth).

    Ranking: Bar charts and Column charts.

    Evolution: Line charts for time-series data.

    Complex Layouts: Using facet_wrap and facet_grid to compare subsets of data.

🛠️ **Tools & Libraries**

    R/RStudio: The primary environment.

    ggplot2: For building the visualisations.

    dplyr / tidyr: For data cleaning and preparation.

    tidyverse: The core ecosystem used throughout the project.
